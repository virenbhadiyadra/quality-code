SUMMARY: High-quality code is essential for long-term success in software development. While some may see it as a time-consuming luxury, it's crucial for maintaining productivity, reducing technical debt, and ensuring a positive user experience. Code quality encompasses clarity, modularity, meaningful naming, low complexity, and idiomatic coding. It impacts development costs, job satisfaction, and product quality. Organizations can promote code quality through sustainable work practices, regular refactoring, technical leadership, and code reviews. Ultimately, investing in code quality is a competitive advantage that benefits both developers and end-users.
2.[Code quality: measuring the business impact of unhealthy code](https://codescene.com/blog/measuring-the-business-impact-of-low-code-quality)
SUMMARY:New research quantifies the business benefits of high-quality code, shedding light on its significance. In the software industry, code quality is often undervalued at the business level. The study reveals that efficient software development offers a competitive edge, with 23-42% of developer time wasted due to technical debt and poor code. High-quality code boasts 15 times fewer bugs, twice the development speed, and 9 times lower completion time uncertainty. The research, based on 39 commercial codebases, aims to bridge the communication gap between developers and non-technical stakeholders, emphasizing the business impact of code quality.
3. [How Can I Improve My Code Quality?](https://duecode.io/blog/how-can-i-improve-my-code-quality/)
SUMMARY: Ensuring good code quality is crucial in software development, involving practices like code reviews, continuous integration, bug analysis, and adherence to coding guidelines. Regular code reviews with the pull request method help maintain quality, reduce bugs, and save time. Continuous Integration (CI) tools like Jenkins aid in early error detection. Code metrics and linters help measure and improve code quality, and clear, readable code is preferred over clever but confusing code. Effective testing and addressing technical debt are vital, along with avoiding excessive comments and prioritizing self-documenting code.
